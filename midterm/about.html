			<h4>You've heard of Picasso, right? 
			Well here, we refer to ourselves as "Picazza," because we truly believe that our work is just as important as his.
			<br><br>
			Founded in 2022, Cassidy's pizza is located in the heart of the City of Townsville. <br><br>
			We are passionate about feeding the locals and giving back to our community. 
			We donate 1% of all our proceeds to the Impoverished Pizza Society, a nonprofit that teaches children in low-income households how to make the perfect pie.
			<br><br>We guarantee* here at Cassidy's Pizza that your tastebuds will be soaring to the heavens with each delicious bite.
			But don't take our word for it! Come on down to 666 Pizza Blvd and try for yourself.

			Who could ask for a more authentic experience?</h6>
